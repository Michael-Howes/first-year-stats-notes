\section{Associations in ordinal data}
Last lecture we defined the odds ratio
\[\ta = \frac{\pi_{11}\pi_{22}}{\pi_{12}\pi_{21}},\]
which measured association in a $2\times 2$ table. For $I \times J$ tables, we also defined the local odds ratios
\[\ta_{ij} =  \frac{\pi_{ij}\pi_{i+1,j+1}}{\pi_{i,j+1}\pi_{i+1,j}}, \]
for $i = 1,\ldots,I-1$ and $j=1,\ldots,J-1$. The local odds ratios are a collection of $(I-1)(J-1)$ parameters that describe the associations in a $I \times J$ table. If $X$ or $Y$ are ordinal variables rather than categorical variables, then we can use fewer parameters to describe the association. Consider the following table:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
        &\multicolumn{3}{c}{Career satisfaction}\\
        \hline 
        Age&1&2&3\\
        \hline
        $<30$&34&53&88\\
        $30-50$&80&174&304\\
        $>50$&29&75&172
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
In this example both $X$ and $Y$ are ordinal and we would like to know does a higher $X$ (age) result in a higher $Y$ (career satisfaction). To answer this question we can use a single parameter of interested instead of analyzing the four local odd ratios. This is done by studying the probabilities of concordance and discordance. 

Note that we can put a partial order on the values $(i,j)$ where $(i,j) \succ (h,k)$ if $i < h$ and $j < k$. In the previous table we would have 
\[(>50,3) \succ (30-50, 2), (30-50, 1), (<30, 2), (<30, 1). \]
We would not have $(>50,3) \succ (>50,2)$ or $(>50,3) \succ (<30,3)$ since we do not allow for either $X$ or $Y$ to tie. A pair of observations $(X_1,Y_1)$ and $(X_2,Y_2)$ are said to be \emph{concordant} if $(X_1,Y_1) \succ (X_2,Y_2)$ or $(X_2, Y_2) \succ (X_1,Y_1)$. In our example a concordant pair is a pair of individuals where one individual is strictly old, and the older one has strictly higher career satisfaction. A pair $(X_1,Y_1)$ and $(X_2,Y_2)$ are \emph{discordant} if $(X_1,Y_2) \succ (X_2, Y_1)$  or $(X_2, Y_1) \succ (X_1,Y_1)$. Thus, a discordant pair is again a pair where one individual is strictly older, but now the older individual has strictly lower career satisfaction. We can then define
\[\pi_c = \Pa(\text{drawing a concordant pair}) = 2\sum_{ij}\pi_{ij} \sum_{h>i,k>j}\pi_{hk},\]
and 
\[\pi_d = \Pa(\text{drawing a discordant pair}) = 2\sum_{ij}\pi_{ij} \sum_{h > i, k<j} \pi_{hk}. \]
The parameter
\[\gamma = \frac{\pi_c-\pi_d}{\pi_c+\pi_d}, \]
is a measure of the ordinal association between $X$ and $Y$. Under the null that there is no ordinal association, $\gamma = 0$. We can estimate $\gamma$ by 
\[\wh{\gamma} = \frac{C-D}{C+D}, \]
where
\[C = 2\sum_{ij}n_{ij} \sum_{h>i,k>j}n_{hk} \text{ and } D = 2\sum_{ij}n_{ij} \sum_{h > i, k<j} n_{hk}.  \]
In our example,
